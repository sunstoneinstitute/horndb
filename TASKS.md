# Follow-up Tasks

Outstanding work deferred from the Stage-1 pass (2026-05-24), ordered by
priority within each category. This file tracks **current state only** — closed
tasks collapse to a one-line link in [Done](#done-for-traceability).

When a task is picked up, move it to its own commit / PR and check it off here
(and in the index) in the same commit.

> **Maintenance:** the [Index](#index) is the TOC — one line per task, mirroring
> its checkbox state, **priority**, and _category_. Each open task mirrors one
> GitHub issue (`sunstoneinstitute/horndb`) via its `([#N](…))` link, on both the
> index line and the body heading, labelled with one `priority:` label
> (`critical`/`high`/`medium`/`low`) and one `category:` label to match. Keep task
> and issue in lockstep, in the same change:
>
> - **Add a task** → open an issue with the matching `priority:` + `category:`
>   labels, then put its `([#N](url))` link on both the index line and the body
>   heading. `gh issue create --title … --label "priority: …" --label "category: …" --body-file …`.
> - **Complete a task** (`[ ]` → `[x]`) → `gh issue close N`. Keep the link for traceability.
> - **Retitle / re-prioritise / re-categorise** → `gh issue edit N` to update the
>   title and swap the `priority:`/`category:` labels so they still match.
> - **Remove a task** → `gh issue close N` (comment why) and drop its `TASKS.md` lines.
>
> The `priority:`/`category:` labels are the GitHub mirror of the taxonomy below; if
> you add a new one here, `gh label create` it first. When a task changes, also
> update `docs/architecture.md` — see `CLAUDE.md` → "Keep the docs in sync".

## HIGH — Performance

- [ ] **SPARQL aggregation runtime: id-based bindings + hash group-by + streaming.**
  ([#128](https://github.com/sunstoneinstitute/horndb/issues/128))
  The SPB nightly serves ~12 aggregation-qps where GraphDB Free serves ~150 (~12×).
  Diagnosis (in-process against the real `HornBackend`; harness at
  `crates/sparql/examples/agg_profile.rs`) shows the gap is structural in the SPARQL
  runtime, not codegen — **PGO is the wrong lever** here. Three causes, by impact:
  (1) the dictionary is defeated at the SPARQL boundary — `HornBackend::scan_bgp`
  (`exec/horn.rs:597-606`) decodes every `TermId` back to a heap `Term::Iri(String)`
  and `Bindings` is `BTreeMap<String, Term>` (`exec/mod.rs:19-22`), so `COUNT(*)` spends
  269 ms allocating 400k×3 strings to count what `len()` knows instantly; (2) `DISTINCT`
  dedup is a linear scan (`runtime.rs::dedup_terms`, O(n·d)→O(n²)) — **fixed separately**
  by the HashSet PR; (3) no streaming / no projection or aggregate pushdown
  (`runtime.rs:26-28` materializes a full `Vec<Bindings>` per node; `plan/planner.rs`
  is a 1:1 lowering with no cost model). Scope: hash group-by, id-based `Bindings`
  (decode to strings only at serialization), then streaming + pushdown. Revisit PGO
  only after this lands. See `docs/architecture.md` §9 and `BENCHMARKS.md`.

- [ ] **SPEC-12 SIMD acceleration layer.** ([#132](https://github.com/sunstoneinstitute/horndb/issues/132))
  A new stable-Rust `std::arch` SIMD layer with runtime AVX-512/AVX2/NEON dispatch +
  a scalar oracle, behind a new zero-dep leaf crate `horndb-simd`
  (`simd → storage → wcoj → …`). **Stage 1a — DONE:** the primitives crate
  (`lower_bound`/`intersect`/`merge`/`dedup`/`filter`+`filter_range`/`gather`, each
  differential-proptested bit-identical vs scalar on every host ISA path, plus the F5
  `with_forced_isa` override and the `intersect` SIMD-vs-scalar bench) landed in
  `crates/simd` (AVX2/AVX-512 on x86_64, NEON on aarch64; scalar-forced build green on
  stable 1.90). Kernels that don't yet clear the NF2 floor ship the scalar-equivalent
  galloping form; the bench is wired but **awaits hornbench measurement** before any wide
  compress/compare kernel is hand-written. **Stage 1b — OPEN:** the WCOJ seek/intersect
  consumer to close SPEC-03 NF1 (`benches/per_tuple.rs` ≤2.5 ns/tuple; `four_cycle`
  no-regress).
  **Stage 2 — DONE (kernels + benches; hornbench numbers pending):** `horndb-storage`
  consumes `horndb-simd` for bulk inline-int dictionary decode
  (`Dictionary::decode_inline_ints`/`lookup_inline_int_batch`/`lookup_batch`) and the
  vectorised `rdf:type` partition scan (`PredicatePartition::subjects_with_object`, built
  on the new `horndb_simd::filter_indices_eq` scan+index-compact primitive +
  `gather`; the primitive is differential-proptested bit-identical vs scalar on every
  host ISA path). The `dict_decode` (≥4×) and `partition_scan` (≥80% STREAM-Triad)
  microbenches are wired and smoke-run; the ≥4× ratio and the NUMA-pinned STREAM-Triad
  fraction are the deferred hornbench-host measurement (`BENCHMARKS.md` rows marked
  pending hornbench). The F2 "encode" stretch (vectorised `intern`) is out of scope.
  **Gated:** the delta-apply merge/dedup SIMD blocks on
  [#133](https://github.com/sunstoneinstitute/horndb/issues/133) (object index) +
  [#134](https://github.com/sunstoneinstitute/horndb/issues/134) (semi-naïve)
  and may be descoped; the `cax-sco` partition-filter scan is out of scope (superseded
  by #133). See `docs/specs/SPEC-12-simd.md`, `docs/architecture.md` §14, `BENCHMARKS.md`.

- [ ] **SPEC-04: within-partition object index on `MemStore`.**
  ([#133](https://github.com/sunstoneinstitute/horndb/issues/133))
  Add `obj_index` (predicate → object → subjects) alongside `by_pred`, maintained in
  `assert`/`insert_inferred`/`clear_inferred`, so `probe(None, p, Some(o))` returns
  O(|extent|) instead of scanning the whole partition. **`TripleStore` trait unchanged**
  — no codegen/`FireFn`/engine change, just `MemStore` internals — so this is the
  low-risk, independently-shippable half. Turns the compiled `cax-sco` inner loop (and
  the F5 list-rule probes) from O(N) to O(|extent(c1)|). Ship **first**.
  Spec: `docs/specs/2026-06-27-owlrl-type-index-seminaive.md` (fix #1). Gate:
  `compiled_rules_ms` drop on the owlrl materialize A/B LUBM-shaped row + resident-set
  delta recorded in `BENCHMARKS.md`; all differential gates stay green.

- [ ] **SPEC-04: genuine delta-driven semi-naïve firing for the compiled rules.**
  ([#134](https://github.com/sunstoneinstitute/horndb/issues/134))
  The compiled rules ignore their `_delta` arg (`engine.rs:127` passes `&Delta::new()`)
  and re-join the whole store every round (~12× redundant re-derivation for a depth-12
  taxonomy). Fire the n-variant delta decomposition instead: `FireFn` signature change
  (AGENTS.md §7) + `Delta` probe surface + `emit.rs` codegen + engine plumbing of the
  already-computed `applied` delta. Compounds with the object index; do **second**,
  measure between. Must stay differential-equal (closure-backend + rdf_type_skew +
  owl2-w3c-rl + acceptance #4 green). Spec:
  `docs/specs/2026-06-27-owlrl-type-index-seminaive.md` (fix #2). Gate: round/inner-loop
  work counters drop, reason-time falls.

## HIGH — Completeness

- [ ] **SPEC-11 SSSOM mappings + compact crosswalk index.**
  ([#130](https://github.com/sunstoneinstitute/horndb/issues/130))
  First-class support for [SSSOM](https://mapping-commons.github.io/sssom/) ontology
  crosswalks (`docs/specs/SPEC-11-mappings.md`). HornDB is the reasoning view — the
  external SoR owns SSSOM storage/ingestion (ADR-0016, data-platform ADR-0002), so
  this is the *reasoning + serving* half: (F1) SKOS/OWL/semapv mapping predicates in
  `crates/owlrl/src/vocab.rs`; (F2) n-ary `sssom:Mapping` node + positive base triple,
  negated = n-ary-only; (F3) the SSSOM chaining rules T1/RCE1-2/RI1-5/RG1-2 compiled
  into `rules.toml` with the transitive subset delegated to GraphBLAS closure (the
  RCE-N OWL rules are already entailed by `cax-*`/`scm-*`); (F4) monotone
  negative-mapping chaining (`Not` as a distinct predicate — preserves SPEC-04's
  negation-free stratification); (F5) the compact crosswalk index — rung-2 (Elias-Fano
  subjects + Frame-of-Reference bit-packed objects, ~10 B/pair bidirectional) baseline,
  rung-4 PGM target; (F6) crosswalk spine; (F7) confidence propagation (product default,
  SeMRA); (F8) chain provenance (`derived_from` = proof premises); (F9) harness-only
  SSSOM/TSV loader. **ADR-0017**: `skos:exactMatch` is a crosswalk edge, *not* OWL
  identity. Gated by a curated SSSOM conformance subset in `harness/selected.toml`;
  benched on hornbench (index ≤ ~10 B/pair; full-closure time vs the OxO2 1.16M-mapping
  / 17-min baseline). Splits into shippable increments (vocab + representation → chain
  rules → index → spine/serving). See `docs/architecture.md` §13.
  **Progress (2026-06-27, branch `spec-11-mappings-reasoning`):** the *reasoning slice*
  is implemented and green — F1 (vocab), F3 (chaining rules), F4 (negative chaining),
  F7 (confidence), F8 (provenance), F9 (harness SSSOM/TSV loader), plus the curated
  SSSOM conformance subset in `harness/selected.toml`. F2 (mapping representation) is
  **partial** — the n-ary `sssom:Mapping` node builder exists; full
  materialization-on-inference is follow-up. Still outstanding (keeps this box
  unchecked): the *serving slice* — F5 (compact crosswalk index) and F6 (crosswalk
  spine), plus GraphBLAS-backend T1 parity. Tracked as a separate serving-slice plan.

## MEDIUM — Performance

- [ ] **LDBC SPB nightly: scale to true SF=0.256 + editorial agents.**
  ([#125](https://github.com/sunstoneinstitute/horndb/issues/125))
  The nightly SPB job (`.github/workflows/nightly.yml`) runs end-to-end on
  `hornbench` but only at **feasible scale** — a ~512k-triple materialized
  closure, aggregation-only, `editorialAgents=0`, so the headline metric is
  `aggregation-qps`, not the LDBC `editorial-qps`. Scale to the true SF=0.256
  (256M-triple) dataset and enable editorial (CW insert/update/delete) agents:
  materialize the 256M closure on `hornbench` and confirm both engines (HornDB
  `serve`, GraphDB Free `spb` repo) can hold it; flip `editorialAgents` on in
  `crates/harness/scenarios/spb-nightly.properties` and reconcile the nominal
  `datasetSize` (currently 18,644,617) with what is actually loaded; move the
  trend metric to `editorial-qps`. See `BENCHMARKS.md` and the SPB nightly row
  in `docs/architecture.md`.

## LOW — Operational

- [ ] **Disk pressure during multi-agent runs.** ([#13](https://github.com/sunstoneinstitute/horndb/issues/13))
  `oxrocksdb-sys` (pulled in transitively by the harness via `oxigraph`)
  compiles a ~700 MB artifact per worktree, which exhausted free space on `/`
  during the 2026-05-24 parallel pass (surfaced as misleading "1Password failed
  to fill whole buffer" signing errors). The vendored GraphBLAS is already
  de-duplicated across worktrees; rocksdb is the remaining driver — point
  `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` at a shared path, prune the rocksdb dep, or document a
  ≥15 GB-free precondition. Stays open until rocksdb duplication is addressed.

- [ ] **1Password SSH agent reliability.** ([#14](https://github.com/sunstoneinstitute/horndb/issues/14))
  The agent intermittently returns "no identities" / "communication with agent
  failed" during long agent sessions even when the desktop app is unlocked. Fix:
  keep the app foregrounded during long sessions, or pre-cache an unencrypted
  signing key for CI. (Bypassing signing is not acceptable — global rule.)

The compiled-rule `rdf:type`-scan hotspot is its own work (object index #133 + semi-naïve #134) per `docs/specs/2026-06-27-owlrl-type-index-seminaive.md` — not this (closed) eq-rep-p issue.
